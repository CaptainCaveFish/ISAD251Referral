###### Application Fact Sheet:
## **Keep your family on-track with our new calendar application**

Modern life can often be very hectic. The average person spends:
* 7 hours a week on homework.[1]
* 34.5 hours a week at work.[2]
* A third of their life asleep.
This leaves very little time for all the other important things that need to be done. Everything from homework, to business meetings, to doctors appointments. Making sure that your family is where it needs to be when it needs to be there can often make what little free time you have full of stress.

Fortunately for you, a solution to this immense problem has become available. Our new application allows you to keep track of all of your families appointments and deadlines from anywhere. Our clear and easy-to-use menu will take all the stress out of managing the time of you and your loved ones, allowing you to fully enjoy your free time.
